<h1>1. A board for update log</h1>
<p>
  <!-- excerpt-start -->
  Added a new bulletin board for update log. Added a link to the board in the
  header and reduced the header size by 20px.
</p>
<br />
<h1>2. Change the internal logic for scrollToTop button</h1>
<p>
  It was implemented with window.scrollY, but now it's updated to work with
  IntersectionObserverAPI for a better performance.
