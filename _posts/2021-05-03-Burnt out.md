<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
  Today I was totally burnt out especially in the evening so i couldn't study enough for ds & algo on leetcode.
  <br><br>
  I feel like i should be more consistent. Take time and do things one by one. I will get there some day if i don't give up in the middle being burnt out.
