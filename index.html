  Hello, strangers. How are you? This is a place where I mainly record my daily
  struggles to become a better version of myself.
  <strike>(mostly miserable)</strike>
  Other than that, I also record other bits of myself like things I learn every
  day to become a front-end developer or anything related to my hobbies. Thanks
  for dropping by ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
