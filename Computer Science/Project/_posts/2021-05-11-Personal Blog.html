  I've already tried documenting how I've worked this project out in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPEZ2S2H9H7TzRyUsoujRQBjT8gLaeGs/view?usp=sharing">MS Word document</a>. 
  Plus, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlRWm-wyYyH6370BLH9LoysII9_l6aIv/view?usp=sharing">Architectural design</a> is also available just in case the img above is too small to see.

<h1>Think and plan ahead before action</h1>
<p>
  During the project, I think I got confused a lot especially about the details of a design.
  And I think it is because I really haven't thought my design through before the start of 
  implementation phase. In other words, the initial skeleton design lacked details.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, I had to design the lacked details along the way during the implmentation 
  phase which caused lot of confusion and inefficiency.
  I don't think I still can design 100% eveyrthing perfectly from the start.
  Obviously, there can be some errors and trials at some point with regards to the design.
  But, it would've been not that chaotic as I've gone through this time, if I had carefully designed
  the skeleton in the initial design phase. I was just rushed to put something out there, being impatient.
</p>
<p>
 So, if I do the project next time, I will probably try to put more time and effort in the 
 initial design phase to minimize the possible confusion which can incur during the next
 implmentation phase.
