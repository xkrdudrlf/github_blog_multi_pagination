<h1>What is the Dynamic Programming?</h1>
<p>
  <!-- excerpt-start -->
  Dynamic Programming is a technique which solves the problem by solving its
  subproblems in an accumulative manner with the help of memoization. In other
  words, we do not attempt to solve the problem directly. Rather, we try to
  solve its subproblems first so that we can use the results of subproblems for
  solving the original problem. However, there can be many overlapping parts
  among subproblems, so we use another technique called "memoization" to avoid
  re-solving the already solved problem.
</p>
<p>
  Memoization is a technique where we store the results of subproblems somewhere
  so that we don't need to re-solve the problem again later when we come across
  the subproblem again during DP.
</p>

<h1>Top-Down vs Bottom-Up</h1>
<p>
  In Dynamic Programming, there are 2 possible approaches to use : Top-down and
  Bottom-Up. Both means what their names literally describe. Top-Down is an
  approach where we start solving the problem from the top(original problem) to
  down(base case) while Bottom-Up is an approach where we start solving the
  problem from the bottom to top.
</p>
<p>
  Both have asymtotically the same time complexity, but considering that
  Top-Down approach uses a recursive function using a stack, there can be a
  limit for using this approach with regards to the max-depth of a stack. On top
  of that, Bottom-Up approach usually has a better performance in that Top-down
  approach has some overheads incurring from procedural calls like recursive
  function calls. However, in unusual cases where Top-down approach does not
  need to go through all the subproblems, Bottom-up approach can have worse
  performance since it always goes through all the possible sub-problems unlike
  Top-down approach.
</p>

<h1>When can we use Dynamic Programming?</h1>
<p>
  I think that DP can be used especially when we have the problem which can be
  solved using the results of its subproblems and subproblems also share the
  same solution logic with the original problem.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, if those subproblems are overlapped each other, then DP can be
  very effective strategy with the help of memoization.
