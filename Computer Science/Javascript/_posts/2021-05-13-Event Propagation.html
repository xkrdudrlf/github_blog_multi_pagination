<h1>Event Propagation: Capturing and Bubbling</h1>
<p>
  <!-- excerpt-start -->
  <b>Capturing Phase</b>: When we click on the element, then the parents of the
  element firstly detects the event and start pushing the event down until the
  event reaches the target element.
  <br />
  <b style="margin-left: 0.5rem">Bubbling Phase</b>: After the capturing phase,
  bubbling phase begins, which means the event starts going up to the parent of
  the target elements until the event reaches the top.
</p>

<br />

<h1>Event Propagation in Practice</h1>
<p>
  .addEventListener usually captures the event during the bubbling phase. To
  modify this so that the event can be captured during the capturing phase, set
  the third parameter of addEventListener function to “true’. But, that is not
  used in most cases.
  <br />
  <b>Inside .addEventListener:</b>
  <br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1rem"
    >- e.target: indicates where the event happened initially.</span
  >
  <br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1rem"
    >- e.currentTarget: indicates the target to which the eventListener is</span
  >
  <br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1rem"
    >- e.stopPropagation: stops further event propagaion to its parents.</span
  >
</p>

<h1>Event Delegation</h1>
<p>
  Event Delegation is a technique which can be used when we have the common way
  of handling the events with multiple elements.
  <br />
  Specifically, we capture and handle the event from their common parent element
  when the target elements have the same way of event handling.
  <br />
  This can be an efficient solution when we have lots of target elements sharing
  same event handling logic since it can save us from having the same multiple
  event handler functions.
