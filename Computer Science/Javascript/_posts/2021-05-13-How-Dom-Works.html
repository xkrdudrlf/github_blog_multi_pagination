<h1>What is DOM ?</h1>
<p>
  <!-- excerpt-start -->
  DOM is a structured representation of HTML documents. It allows JavaScript to
  access the HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
</p>
<p>
  <b>DOCUMENT</b> is the special object that is the entry point to the DOM like
  “document.querySelector()”. And the child of DOM object is the
  <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> which is the root element of the all HTML elements. Next
  are the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> elements which are the
  children of the &lt;html&gt; element.
</p>

<br />

<h1>DOM !== JavaScript</h1>
<p>
  DOM methods and properties are not part of JavaScript.
  <b
    >DOM methods and properties are actually part of WEB APIs which are like
    libraries that browsers implement in JavaScript language and we can access
    them from our JavaScript code.</b
  >
  Since there is actually an official DOM specification each browser has to
  implement, we can do the same DOM manipulations in all browsers.
