Nowadays, i keep studying more than 8 hrs per day though i bludges for a while in the day.
I think its mainly due to the blog project since it just eats up large chunk of time easily. And I dont think i am fully concentrated while i'm doing the project compared to taking a course since all i do for project is mostly a series of "Googling & Being Frustrated for a while". 
<br>
Anyhow, hope i can finally finish template files for post. So, I would not need to manually template the post like now i'm doing. And i think i'm putting too much time on learning this jekyll & liquid stuffs rather than practicing html/css/js which i originally wanted to do.
<br>
I better finish this project asap so that I can practice more on html/css/js before moving on to js. At the moment, I'm thinking of cloning some popular website for practices like i was doing with starbuck page.(Hmm i probs should restart the project again once i finish this)
