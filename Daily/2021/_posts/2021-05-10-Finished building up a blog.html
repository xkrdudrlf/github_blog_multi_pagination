  Finally, I see the end of this project though there won't be end if i really
  purse the perfection. But, at least for now, except the fixed ^Top icon
  button, Basic functionalities of blog are implemented I think. More than
  anything, I found myself spending too much time mostly on visual design, which
  shouldn't be my priority though I enjoyed doing it. I've got tons of things to
  learn and I am still even not good with Javascript. So I think i will just
  wrap this project up this point.

  Since I started building this blog up last Monday. It took exactly about a
  week for me to build this blog. I really didn't expect it to take this much
  time since I already knew how to create static pages with html/css/js.
</p>
<p>
  It took a bit of time until I feel like digging a rabbit hole. Firstly, I
  learnt that Github Pages is run with Jekyll, so I picked it up. Soon, I also
  realized that I need to use bit of Liquid to use Jekyll efficiently.. So i
  picked up bit of Liquid and that wasnt the end of course. Jekyll Plugins, Git
  submodule, Travis CI.. I've learnt much more than I expected from the project.
  I still don't think I really picked up Everything completly. But, at least, I
  think I understand most of them on a conceptual level and I feel now bit
  confident with Jekyll and Liquid though I am not sure when I will use it again
</p>

  Since I started studying CS at Uni, I really didn't have enough time or mental
  energy. I managed to pass the courses fortunetely, but was mostly at the brink
  of mental breakdown due to my personal problems. Thanks to Corona virus, now I
  came back home and and finally picking up the broken pieces of myself with the
  help of my family. And this is the first project ever I've done myself from
  the start to the end. Hope that this would be the turning point to put my life
  back on the route. Never Give up !
