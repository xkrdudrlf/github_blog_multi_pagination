  Today was very confusing day with ups and downs. At least till this morning, I
  was so happy that I finally get my blog work with Travis CI, which was the
  most hardest part for me. And The only thing left for me to do was just same
  designing and implementing phase for post/footer and bit of media queries to
  make the blog site responsive.
  <br />
  Being hopeful, after lunch, I strated documenting what I've done so far in the
  project for the future reference and to record my learnings from this project.
  And it was also not that bad, I quite enjoyed writing it out.
  <br />
  And after that, around dinner time, eveyrthing started getting hairy all of a
  sudden.. My vscode terminal starts not showing anything just being blank for
  no reason. And that completely sent me on a wild-goose chase since it turned
  out that there was nothing wrong with me, rahter it was due to some mysterious
  incompatibility existing between VS Code and my zsh theme (10k sth whatever).
  <br />
  Till I finally figured that out, I literally uninstalled and installed
  everything suspcious.. literally everything.. I firstly reset my zsh thinking
  i might've modified some parts accidentally and VS Code after that. In the
  end, after finding out what is the cause, i had to revert every set up env
  back to what they were which was another pain in the neck ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥.
  <br />
  Anyway... I'm just trying to think that it was an another good revision of how
  VS Code work and zsh.. (<strike>Nope</strike>).
